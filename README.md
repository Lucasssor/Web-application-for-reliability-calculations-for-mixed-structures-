Web application for reliability calculations for mixed structures

This repository contains the source code for my engineering thesis project. The application is designed to perform reliability calculations for mixed structures, providing an intuitive web-based interface for inputting parameters and analyzing results. The project includes dynamic form generation based on user-defined inputs and implements key reliability assessment methods.

Additionally, the repository includes an Excel file with VBA code that allows users to verify and analyze data. This provides an alternative method for conducting reliability calculations directly within Excel.

JavaScript, VBA, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
